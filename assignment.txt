Exercise: Scheduling App
 
Design and implement the API for a minimal scheduling application. This 
API should be able to handle the following requirements:
 
1) Create persons with a name and unique email.
2) Create meetings involving one or more persons at a given time slot.
3) A meeting can only start at the hour mark and only last exactly one hour.
4) Show the schedule, i.e., the upcoming meetings, for a given person.
5) Suggest one or more available timeslots for meetings given a group of persons.

You should not implement a GUI, a simple unit test or console demo 
should suffice. Also please try to keep the number of third party 
libraries to a minimum. Finally, please do not spend time on storing 
data in files or databases.

The exercise should be solved in Java or TypeScript.

The estimated work effort for this exercise is 2-3 hours. If you make any
implementation compromises, please make sure to document those. You will be evaluated both on your coding style and your ability to make the right implementation compromises.
